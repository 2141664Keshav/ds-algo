What is the time complexity of the following code snippet?

int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; j <= N; j++) {
    for (int j = i; j <= N && j > i; j++) {
        sum += i;
    }
}

Answer: O(N)

The inner loop will never as j starts from i, and the inequality for j to be greater than i prevents
the inner loop from ever running
